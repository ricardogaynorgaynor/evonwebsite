People who've never used Twitter often want the site explained to them. They often say, "I just don't understand it."
Even when someone tells them the basics of how Twitter operates, they ask, "Why would anyone use Twitter?"
It's actually a pretty good question. With this overview, get a crash course on Twitter and all of its functionalities.

                                    <p>Micro-blogging is defined as a quick update usually containing a very limited number of characters.
It is a popular feature of social networks like Facebook, where you can update your status, but it has become best known because of Twitter.
In essence, micro-blogging is for people who want a blog but don't want to blog. A personal blog can keep people informed on what is going on in your life, but not everyone wants to spend an hour crafting a beautiful post about the vibrant colours seen on a butterfly spotted in the front time. Sometimes, you just want to say, "I went shopping for a new car but didn't find anything" or "I watched 'Dancing with the Stars' and Warren Sapp sure can dance."
So what is Twitter? It's a great place for keeping people informed on what you are up to without the need to spend a lot of time crafting an entire post on the subject. You just say what's up and leave it at that.

                                    <p>While Twitter may have started as a micro-blogging service, it is grown into much more than simply a tool to type in quick status updates.
So when asked what Twitter is, I often describe it as a cross between blogging and instant messaging, though even that doesn't do it justice.
Put simply, Twitter is social messaging. With the ability to follow people and have followers and interact with Twitter on your cell phone, Twitter has become the perfect social messaging tool.
Whether you are out on the town and want to coordinate with a group of people about which hot spot to hit next or keep people informed of developments at a company-sponsored event, Twitter is a great tool for quickly communicating a message to a group.

Outdoor festivals like the South-by-Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, and major events like the E3 conference have shown what a great resource Twitter can be for quickly reporting news to a huge group of people. Faster and more immediate than a blog, Twitter has been embraced by the "new media" of the blogosphere and has slowly won acceptance among traditional media outlets.

                                    <p>Twitter has become a favourite target for social media marketing. This new form of getting the message out has been used effectively by politicians during their campaigns and by news publications and celebrities as a quick way to connect with an audience.
With utilities like Twitter feed, it is easy to convert an RSS feed into Twitter updates.
This makes it easy to use Twitter as a form of social media marketing.

                                        This brings us back to the original question. What is Twitter? It is many different things to many different people. It can be used by a family to keep in touch, a company to coordinate business, the media to keep people informed or a writer to build up a fan base.
Twitter is micro-blogging. It is social messaging. It is an event coordinator, a business tool, news reporting service and a marketing utility. If you try it and don't like it, you can delete your account in just a few seconds.
What is this trendy thing called Instagram that all the cool kids seem to be into? It's been around for a few years, quietly picking up traction mostly thanks to everybody's new obsession with mobile photography, so don't feel embarrassed to ask if you have absolutely no clue what it's all about.
An Intro to Instagram
Instagram is a social networking app made for sharing photos and videos from a smartphone.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Similar to Facebook or Twitter, everyone who creates an Instagram account has a profile and a news feed.
When you post a photo or video on Instagram, it will be displayed on your profile. Other users who follow you will see your posts in their own feed. Likewise, you'll see posts from other users whom you choose to follow.
Pretty straight forward, right? It's like a simplified version of Facebook, with an emphasis on mobile use and visual sharing. Just like other social networks, you can interact with other users on Instagram by following them, being followed by them, commenting, liking, tagging and private messaging. You can even save the photos you see on Instagram.
Devices That Work With Instagram
Instagram is available for free on iOS and Android devices.
It can also be accessed on the web from a computer, but users can only upload and share photos or videos from their devices.
Creating an Account on Instagram
Before you can start using the app, Instagram will ask you to create a free account.
You can sign up via your existing Facebook account or by email. All you need is a username and a password.
You may be asked if you want to follow some friends who are on Instagram in your Facebook network. You can do this right away or skip through the process and come back to it later. 
It's always a good idea to customize your profile by adding your name, a photo, a short bio and a website link if you have one when you first get on Instagram.
 </p>
<br>
<p>
When you start following people and looking for people to follow you back, they'll want to know who you are and what you're all about.
Using Instagram as a Social Network
As previously mentioned, Instagram is all about visual sharing, so everybody's main intention is to share and find only the best photos and videos. Every user profile has a “Followers” and “Following” count, which represents how many people they follow and how many other users are follow them.
Every user profile has a button you can tap to follow them. If a user has their profile set to private, they will need to approve your request first.
Keep in mind that when your profile is created and set to public, anyone can find and view your profile, along with all your photos and videos. Learn how to set yours to private if you only want the followers you approve to be able to see your posts.
Interacting on posts is fun and easy. You can double tap any post to “like” it or add a comment at the bottom. You can even click the arrow button to share it with someone via direct message.
If you want to find or add more friends or interesting accounts to follow, use the search tab (marked by the magnifying glass icon) to browse through tailored posts recommended to you.
 </p>
<br>
<p>
 You can also use the search bar at the top to look for specific users or hashtags. 
Applying Filters and Editing Your Instagram Posts
Instagram has come a long way since its early days in terms of posting options. When it first launched in 2010, users could only post photos through the app and add filters without any extra editing features.
Today, you can post both directly through the app or from existing photos/videos on your device. You can also post both photos and videos up to one full minute in length, and you have a whole bunch of extra filter options plus the ability to tweak and edit.
When you tap the middle Instagram posting tab, you can select the camera or video icon to let the app know whether you want to post a photo or a video.
Capture it through the app, or tap the photo/video preview box to pull up a previously captured one.
Instagram has up to 23 filters you can choose to apply to both photos and videos. By tapping the Edit option at the bottom of the photo editor, you can also apply editing effects that allow you to edit adjustments, brightness, contrast and structure. For videos, you can trim them and select a cover frame.
If you want to edit your photo or video within the Instagram app, simply tap the wrench icon and choose a feature from the bottom menu. You can adjust the contrast, warmth, saturation, highlights, shadows, vignette, tilt shift and sharpness.
Sharing Your Instagram Posts
After you’ve applied an optional filter and possibly made some edits, you’ll be taken to a tab where you can fill out a caption, tag other users to it, tag it to a geographical location and simultaneously post it to some of your other social networks.
Once it's published, your followers will be able to view it and interact with in their feeds. You can always delete your posts or edit their details after you published them by tapping the three dots at the top.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You can configure your Instagram account to have photos posted on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or Flickr. If these sharing configurations are all highlighted, as opposed to remaining gray and inactive, then all of your Instagram photos will automatically be posted to your social networks after you press Share. If you don't want your photo shared on any particular social network, simply tap any one of them so that it's gray and set to Off.
Viewing and Publishing Instagram Stories
Instagram recently introduced its new Stories feature, which is a secondary feed that appears at the very top of your main feed. You can see it marked by little photo bubbles of the users you follow.
Tap any one of these bubbles to see that user's story or stories that they published over the last 24 hours. If you're familiar with Snapchat, then you'll probably notice how similar Instagram's stories feature is to it.
To publish your own story, all you have to do is tap your own photo bubble from the main feed or swipe right on any tab to access the stories camera tab. If you want to find out more about Instagram stories, check out this breakdown of how it differs from Snapchat.

 The new Snapchat isn’t going anywhere (no matter how many times we beg and plead for our old app back). Parent company Snap Inc. warned us in January that the update was coming, and yet we turned a blind eye to the news. Now we’re stuck with it. Although it hurts, it’s time we start learning how to use the new Snapchat.
First thing’s first: Let’s talk about the app’s new organization method. Your friends’ content appears to the left of the camera screen, and media content displays to the right. It seems like this is a no-brainer design to keep personal and public content separate. But the issue is that it’s hard to teach all of us old dogs new tricks. Plus, this new design has totally cluttered the app.
For example, Snapchat lumped stories and direct snaps from friends on the same page, which can be accessed by swiping right from the camera screen. This page, called the Friends page, ranks your friends based on who you keep in touch with most regularly.
To watch a Story, tap the circle with the blue outline and tap through like usual. You will then see a preview of the next friend’s story pop up. You can tap to watch, swipe to skip, or swipe down to exit Story mode altogether.
